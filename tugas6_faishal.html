        <h3 class="head">WHERE PASSION, STORIES, AND CRAFTMANSHIP COLLIDE</h3>
            <p>The Compass® brand was established in 1998 in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. It was founded by Mr. Kahar Gunawan 
                who wanted to rebuild a shoe factory based upon the vision left by his father, Mr. Kahar Setiadi. The Compass® ethos 
                has always been to produce good quality footwear that evoke a sense of pride when worn. Through a strong focus in design 
                and storytelling, Compass® shoes tells the story of its culture, community and collaborators. In 2018, the Compass® brand 
                was reimagined with a fresh contemporary touch, while continuing to uphold its historical roots through the Gazelle® identity.
            </p>   
            <br>
        <h3 class="head">FOUNDER’S VISION </h3>
            <p>We, at Compass®, have a vision to make  Compass® the leading footwear brand in Indonesia that instills local pride and uplifts 
                the reputation of Indonesian footwear industry. Through collaborations, we hope, we can give greater impact not only to our 
                partners and  Compass®, but also to the consumers.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h3 class="head">THE SPIRIT OF GAZELLE® LOGO</h3>
            <p>The logo created by Mr. Kahar Setiadi in 1983, was inspired by Gazelle®, an animal known for its swiftness and agility. 
                He wished the new brand he created would encapsulate the same spirit. 35 years later, the Gazelle® logo is revitalised in 
                the 2018 Compass® Reborn collection, as a homage to the late Mr. Kahar Setiadi and celebration of the Gazelle brand's renown 
                during the 1980s.

        <h3 class="head">MEET AJI HANDOKO PURBO</h3>
            <p>Being the Creative Director of Indonesia's most hyped and loved shoe brand, Aji Handoko Purbo, has successfully made a name 
                for himself, by being the most sought-after Creative Director in the country. Aji has massively contributed to the success 
                story of Compass® brand, making this local label one of the Top of Mind, cult brand in the nation. Today, Aji has proven 
                himself to be a well-respected and one of the most admired personas in Indonesia's youth culture movement. He envisions 
                that by building this so called ecosystem, it can provide a support system for the players to thrive not only locally but 
                onto the global stage as well.

            <br>
        <h3 class="head">Turning consumers to believers.</h3>
            <p>From the very first day, our unshaken belief in the power of authentic storytelling has carried us until today. 
                It’s a movement to champion Indonesian products through the stories of consumers who become believers. Our journey starts 
                from the grassroots and we are still strong believers that the power of the community, of our bonds within those communities 
                shines through in our stories which creates impact.
